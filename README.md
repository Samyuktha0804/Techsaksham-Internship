Abstract:
Developed a rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simulate human-like conversational interaction across multiple domains such as customer support, education, and general queries. Leveraged SpaCy for text preprocessing and implemented intent recognition through pattern matching, enabling the chatbot to respond appropriately to user input. The system is lightweight and modular, serving as an ideal introductory NLP project.

Step-by-Step Process to Implement the Project:

Understand the Problem
Defined the chatbotâ€™s purpose and selected use-case domains such as greetings, jokes, and weather responses.

Set Up the Environment
Installed required libraries including SpaCy and loaded the en_core_web_sm language model for natural language understanding.

Design Intents and Patterns
Created a structured set of intents (e.g., greetings, farewells, weather) with corresponding user input patterns and predefined response lists.

Develop Intent Recognition
Processed user input using NLP techniques like tokenization and normalization, and matched inputs against predefined patterns to identify user intent.

Generate Responses
Mapped recognized intents to a set of randomized predefined responses and included fallback responses for unmatched queries.

Build the Chat Loop
Implemented a loop for continuous user interaction with an exit condition ("quit" command) to end the session.

Test and Validate
Tested the chatbot with varied inputs to confirm correct intent recognition and appropriate responses.

Enhance the Functionality
Expanded the chatbot with new intents and integrated enhancements like context-aware responses and potential sentiment analysis.

Technologies Used: Python, SpaCy, NLP (Rule-Based), Console I/O
